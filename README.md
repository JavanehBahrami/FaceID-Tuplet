# Face Verification with Tuplet Loss

This repository implements a face verification system based on FaceNet fine-tuned using Tuplet Loss. 
The project leverages PyTorch for deep learning and focuses on learning discriminative embeddings for facial images, especially in cases where `faces are close to the camera` such as in eKYC systems.

## Features
- Fine-tuned FaceNet model for face verification.
- Tuplet Loss: Uses one positive sample and multiple negative samples for robust learning.
- Embedding learning to enhance discriminative power for facial distances.
- Optimized for challenging scenarios where faces are captured at close range.

### Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-verification-tuplet-loss.git
cd face-verification-tuplet-loss
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have PyTorch installed with the appropriate CUDA version for your setup. Refer to the PyTorch Installation Guide if needed.

Dataset
Prepare your dataset with face images. The dataset should be structured to include:
One positive image pair (same person).
Multiple negative samples (different persons).
Examples of datasets:
Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)
VGGFace2
Usage
Training
To train the model with your dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 20 --batch_size 32
Inference
To verify two face images:

bash
Copy code
python verify.py --img1 /path/to/image1.jpg --img2 /path/to/image2.jpg
